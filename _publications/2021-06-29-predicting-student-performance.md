In this paper, we present a model that predicts students' performance using teacher observation reports. We compare the performance of the model using TF-IDF vectors and BERT embeddings. This paper is the first to utilize teacher reports for performance prediction. We presented the paper in June 2021, at the Educational Data Mining Conference online.
