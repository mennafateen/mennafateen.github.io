In this study, we analyze the topics, and psychological features in teachersâ€™ daily written reports and apply them to the student performance prediction model. Experimental results show the capability of this approach in contributing to the accuracy of performance prediction models. We presented the paper in July 2022, at the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education online.
